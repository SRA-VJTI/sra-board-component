/**
 * The exact working of this is a bit hard to understand, so this is example. Below are the given states of motor drivers
 * 
 * Motor Driver A: Normal
 * Motor Driver B: Off
 * Mode = 7, so for mode = 7,
 * mask = bitmask[7] = 0x0F = 00001111
 * data = 0xAA = 10101010
 * 
 * Since, motor driver A is in normal mode and motor driver B is off, we can only use IN5 - IN8 pins of the bar graph LED
 * 
 * ```
 * LED1 <-----> Motor Driver A (IN1) ----- 0    
 * LED2 <-----> Motor Driver A (IN2) ----- 0    
 * LED3 <-----> Motor Driver A (IN3) ----- 0    
 * LED4 <-----> Motor Driver A (IN4) ----- 0    
 * LED5 <--X--> Motor Driver B (IN5) ----- 1    
 * LED6 <--X--> Motor Driver B (IN6) ----- 1    
 * LED7 <--X--> Motor Driver B (IN7) ----- 1    
 * LED8 <--X--> Motor Driver B (IN8) ----- 1    
 * ```
 *   
 * Mask ==> 00001111 => 0x0F
 * 
 * Now, if data is 10101010, then even though pins IN1-IN4 are being used by motor driver, it will be set by gpio_set_level, which will
 * crash the esp32 device. So, we check in the bitmask if the following pin is free or not, if bit is 1, it can be used, if it is 0, then
 * it can't be used.
 * 
 * So, to achieve this we bitwise-and the mask with 0x80(10000000), if result is 0x80, then leftmost bit is 1, else it is 0.
 * If leftmost bit is 1, means we can use this pin of bar graph, then we do the same thing with data, bitwise-and it with 0x80,
 * to find the leftmost bit, if it is 1, the pin is set to 1, else 0. Now we left shift the data and mask variable.
 * 
 * @brief Set the value of bar graph LED
 * 
 * @param data 8bit binary in hexadecimal form, i.e, the pattern that is needed to be shown on the bar graph LED
 * @return esp_err_t returns ESP_OK
